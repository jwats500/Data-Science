# Machine Learning Projects
Collection of projects done by Jay Watson (and teammates) during the Master's Degree program at GeorgiaTech, shared to exhibit coding skills.

Projects included:
1. Visualizing a World of Art:
This project features multiple API calls, extensive data cleaning, complex visualizations including a Choropleth map, and a large and complex neural network written in Python's Tensorflow library. It was created by a team of 5 working together remotely on teams and github.

This app (hosted in streamlit) allows users to upload a photo and then uses a neural network to search museums worldwide and return a painting most similar to the uploaded image (it works well with selfies!). 

2. Simulating Supply Lines:
This project uses agent-based simulation (written in Netlogo) to recreate a major battle between the British and Japanese in WWII and test how hypothetical changes could have affected history, focusing on the supply situation of the Japanese army. Also applies regressions to analyze the results of the simulation.
